# Shieldhub Security Portal
<<<<<<< Updated upstream

Shieldhub is our UI prototype built using Figma and React and deployed through Github Pages. It does not require backend services, databases or account creation at this time.
This prototype is feature-complete with regards to the 3 tasks we set out to fulfill in DP3, capable of helping interested users in efforts to improve their account security.

Shieldhub is our UI prototype built using React, Vite & Tailwind CSS that demonstrates our digital security dashboard that guides and informs users about their online security practices. It does not require backend services, databases or account creation within the scope of the prototype we have developed for the course.

# Digital Security Dashboard Wireframe

This is a code bundle for Digital Security Dashboard Wireframe. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/Fg6RYG7o7NRm4MIGeAp7k0/Digital-Security-Dashboard-Wireframe.

# Changes from DP4
Many changes have been made in the prototype to better align with Heuristic violations discovered by our classmates. Some of the fixes we've made to improve our prototype with regards to usability include:
- Forcing completion of steps before a user can say they have "Completed all fixes".
- Auto-Scroll so users know they've moved onto another step.
- Enhanced visual design with more stylized font and colors in line with the website logo.
- Condensed the steps to fix security concerns into more clear, concise instructions.

## Running the code
Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

## Using the UI

The project is fully deployed using github sites on the following url:
https://krantuckety.github.io/cs4352_Team7/

Accounts are hard-coded into the prototype at this time, so no real authentication nor personal data is needed.
Rather, the prototype simulates how a user would interact with the platform as if they were using their accounts and taking steps to address security defficiencies.
