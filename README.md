# Shieldhub Security Portal

Shieldhub is our UI prototype built using Figma and React and deployed through Github Pages. It does not require backend services, databases or account creation at this time.
This prototype is feature-complete with regards to the 3 tasks we set out to fulfill in DP3, capable of helping interested users in efforts to improve their account security.

# Digital Security Dashboard Wireframe

This is a code bundle for Digital Security Dashboard Wireframe. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/Fg6RYG7o7NRm4MIGeAp7k0/Digital-Security-Dashboard-Wireframe.

## Running the code

Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

## Using the UI

The project is fully deployed using github sites on the following url:
https://krantuckety.github.io/cs4352_Team7/

Accounts are hard-coded into the prototype at this time, so no real authentication nor personal data is needed.
Rather, the prototype simulates how a user would interact with the platform as if they were using their accounts and taking steps to address security defficiencies.
